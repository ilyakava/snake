Snake
===
* My implementation of the classic snake game in JavaScript with Tron-like styling
* ![image](http://imgur.com/XaoV6Oi.gif)
* Choose how fast you want the game to go, and how dense you want the board to be with the [jQuery-Knob](https://github.com/aterrien/jQuery-Knob) plugin
* Game speeds up as you eat more apples!

TODO
=======
* refactor turning code to use Block class's built in east/west/n/s methods
* add game over and game paused screen text
* add sounds
