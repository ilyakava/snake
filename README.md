TODO
=======
* refactor turning code to use Block class's built in east/west/n/s methods
* restrict one turn per step to avoid self eating turn arounds on quick U-turns at low play speeds
* add ability to select speed of play
* add ability to select size of the board
* dynamically adjust size of squares based on board size
* add water ripples
* add game over and game paused screen text
* add sounds
